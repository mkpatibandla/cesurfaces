&nbsp;</font></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">Firstly decide on the material, its color or grouping and the surface lengths and depths that you require. Consider other requirements you may have like sink or hob cut-outs and tap-holes. These all add to the final cost. Once you have established your requirements we will then advise you of the details we require for a more detailed quotation.</p>
						<p align="justify">Provide a final design ranging from kitchen and bathroom countertops, vanity tops, table tops and bases your project. You will be involved in every aspect of the process until you are completely satisfied with the final concept. Once you have accepted our quotation,  it will be manufactured to the agreed specification within 2 - 3 weeks. We understand that as a homeowner who will experience the small inconveniences associated with home improvement work, you will be anxious to have your work completed in a timely manner. That is why we strive to complete the work as quickly as possible.<p align="justify">We will be happy to assist you throughout the decision making process or refer you to our list of subcontractors. If you have additional questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us via e-mail or call our showroom during business hours. We will be happy to help.</td>

						<td>
						<p align="justify">In order to provide a design and quotation we require a sketch or architect's drawing of your project. We will work with you until you are completely satisfied with the final design. Once you have accepted our quotation, if necessary we will carry out a site survey to prepare templates. We fabricate from plans or templates. These can be studio plans or architects drawings. After fabrication we will deliver and install at any Massachusetts location. we will schedule a site measurement and prepare a custom-made template of your project area. This insures a precise fit and finish. Within two weeks after we make a template, we'll come back and install your stone.</td>

						<td><b><font color="#560701">Why is Granite good for kitchen countertops?<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">Granite is well-suited for kitchen countertops because it is highly resistant to household acids such as citrus and vinegar and is hard enough to resist scratching from knives, pots and pans. It is also unaffected by typical kitchen heat such as hot pots or spilled liquid.</td>

						<td><b><font color="#560701">Can Granite be damaged?<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">Like any solid surface, high impact blows can harm Granite. Its crystalline structure makes it somewhat vulnerable to chipping from the blunt force of very hard objects. Products such a oil, coffee, juice, and wine can cause stains or discoloration on unsealed Granite. Heat from pots and pans or burning liquids will not affect Granite under normal circumstances.</td>

						<td><b><font color="#560701">What is flamed Granite? <br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">Granite is flamed by applying blowtorch-strength heat to the surface of the stone. This causes the surface to melt and some of the crystals to shatter; leaving a highly textured surface that is ideal for exterior paving or wet areas where a non-slippery surface is required.</td>

						<td><b><font color="#560701">What is honed Granite?<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">Strictly speaking, Granite is called &#8220;honed&#8221; when the polishing process is halted just before a reflective shiny surface is achieved. This gives a softer, matte appearance to the stone. While some fabricators can hone polished Granite slabs with special equipment, sometimes this process leaves imperfections on the surface of the stone.</td>

Will I have these on my kitchen counters?<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">Granite&#8217;s crystalline structure always has tiny pits and small spaces between the various mineral crystals. Such pits are not readily apparent on large pieces because the overall appearance is polished and mirror like. In addition, some Granite slabs has natural fissures and cracks that are not necessarily structural defects. These fissures are occur naturally and are the result of the immense heat and pressure which originally formed the Granite.</td>

&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">True geological Marble is Limestone 
						that has been subjected to great pressure and heat. 
						During the process, the stone&#8217;s internal structure is 
						changed to a crystalline, sugary consistency. The 
						resulting stone is generally white, sometimes 
						translucent, and has some veining or color that comes 
						from the infusion of other minerals. White Carrara, 
						Thassos, Colorado Yule and Bianco Rosa are examples of 
						true marbles.</td>

						<tr>
						<td><b><font color="#560701">What is the difference between Granite and Marble?<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">While both stones are quarried from the earth, granite and marble are very different. Granite is crystallized minerals that are formed deep in the earth&#8217;s mantle at extremely high temperatures. It is characteristically very hard and highly resistant. Marble starts out as sediment animal skeletons and shells, plant matter, and silt at the bottom of bodies of water. After millions of years,  this solidifies into stone. Since its main component is calcium, marble is softer and less resistant than Granite to acids such as vinegar and citrus beverages.</td>

						<td><b><font color="#560701">What is the best way to clean Marble and other stones?<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></td>
					</tr>
						<tr>
						<td>
						<p align="justify">The old rule of thumb is never use anything you would not use to wash your hands. Never use powdered cleansers or abrasive pads to clean a stone surface. Even &#8220;Soft Scrub&#8221; type cleaners contain pumice, a powdered volcanic stone that will damage your stone countertops or floors. Never use any product which is acidic including substances like ammonia or many common liquid cleaners such as Windex. Always use sealers and cleaning products designed specifically for natural stone. There are excellent stone-friendly cleaning products on the market.</td>

						<td>
						<p align="justify">We do ask that you have your existing countertops completely removed before we come to your home to make a template. If you intend to purchase new cabinets, they should be completely installed before we make final measurements. In addition, you will need to have the following items (if they apply to your project) available for our installer to either measure or take with him back to the fabrication shop.</td>

						<td>
						<p align="justify">If elements of your home improvement project include new windows, flooring, painting, etc., it is best that those projects are completed prior to the installation of your countertop. Of course there are exceptions to this rule. Do not hesitate to ask for assistance in the determination of the order of work to be completed. </td>
